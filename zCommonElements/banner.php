        <p>GeoLens is an interactive visual analytics framework. GeoLens provides fast and expressive interactions with
            voluminous geo-spatial datasets. We provide an expressive visual query evaluation scheme to support advanced
            interactive visual analytics technique, such as brushing and linking. To achieve this, we designed and
            developed
            the Geohash based image tile generation algorithm that automatically adjusts the range of data to access
            based
            on the minimum acceptable size of the image tile.</p>
